        "3. All the columns are divided into three dtypes-Objects Floats & Int.\n",
        "4. This Datasheet does have duplicate as well as null values. There are total of 31994 duplicate values and four columns have missing values.\n",
        "5. The maximum number of missing values are from 'Company' column the followed by 'Agent','Country' and 'Children' columns. The 'Children' columns consists of only 4 null values while 'Company' columns consists of 112593 null values.\n",
        "6. In this project, i have divided the data manipulation workflow into three different categories i.e., Data collection, Data cleaning and manipulation and EDA.\n",
